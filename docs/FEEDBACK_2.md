- after the LN address is created the app name should be updated to match it
- how do the balances work? they need to be fetched, local balances won't work
- the community funding and feature bounties should be subwallet NWC_URLs (that include lud16) - this way we can fetch their balances
- on the leadboard displays "Title" seems wrong, should be "Tier"?
- Need an about/faq page linked from the homepage + custody warning on there for humans (currently this is only in llms.txt)

new bounties:

- direct topup integration with lendasat and Fixed Float
- reward a share of routing earnings to active wallets
- NWC app store for humans & agents
